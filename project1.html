            <p>During this project we started by making a texture in Adobe Photoshop, which we had to later import into Blender to add to our can</p>
		    <p>For the model of the can itself we got a tutorial from school which explained the basics of the program. Even though we had a tutorial we did have to figure out a lot of stuff on our own.</p>
		    <p>Above this text you will see the final render of what I made in Blender. I don't have a lot of experience in Blender but I am always ready to learn.</p>
