                <p>This is my first attempt at a 2D platformer, or at least the start of one. Due to having a short time limit on this assignment I only made an example of the style I was planning on using in this platformer.</p>
                <p>I designed a character, made animations for this character and wrote a movement script for the character using C#. After that was done I imported the character into the Unity editor and started working on level assets.</p>
                <p>Now I have to be honest, for most of the level assets I used pre made assets I found on the asset store from Unity. These assets serve as placeholders until I make my own assets for the platformer</p>
